# Change Log

All notable changes to the "ctrlztree" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **V4 Architecture**: New event-driven history core with append-only event log, pure projection, and ContentStore with LRU/snapshot/diff strategies
- **HistoryController**: Bridges legacy CtrlZTree with new event log + projection model. Manages commit/undo/redo/checkout lifecycle and encrypted persistence
- **TreeView Sidebar**: Dedicated sidebar panel showing current HEAD, undo targets, and redo branches with content previews
- **AI Pipeline**: Provider-based AI with OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic Messages, and custom HTTP JSON providers. Supports history node naming, summarization, and operation planning
- **Encrypted Persistence**: AES-256-GCM encrypted event log with fingerprint-based file naming. Configurable mode: off/ask/on
- **RequestScheduler**: AI request concurrency control, rate limiting, retry with backoff, and cancellation
- **DiffContentRegistry**: Opaque ID-based diff content mapping to prevent source content in URI query strings
- **Redactor**: Sensitive data redaction for AI prompts and logs (API keys, tokens, PEM keys, secrets)
- **Merge Engine**: Linear history chain merging with plan validation, preview, and execution
- **Pruning Engine**: Archive-first history pruning with configurable node limits
- **Delete Engine**: Soft/hard delete with plan validation and orphan detection
- **Logger**: Configurable logging levels (debug/info/warn/error/off) with dynamic reconfiguration

### Changed
- **Undo/Redo**: Now routes through HistoryController for consistent event logging and projection updates
- **Webview navigate**: Uses HistoryController.checkout() for consistent state management
- **Persistence**: Defaults to off (was auto-on). User must explicitly enable or approve
- **CSP**: Removed `unsafe-inline` from webview Content-Security-Policy
- **AI baseUrl**: Enforced HTTPS-only (localhost HTTP allowed for development)
- **TreeView previews**: Show first line only for better privacy
- **Package engines**: Raised minimum VS Code to ^1.67.0 (uses vscode.tabGroups API)

### Fixed
- **Dual-store consistency**: undo/redo/webview navigate now route through single HistoryController path
- **Deactivate data loss**: `deactivate()` now awaits flushToDisk with 3-second timeout
- **RequestScheduler**: Retry no longer double-books concurrent slots; NaN sleep on maxRequestsPerHour=0 fixed
- **DocumentTaskQueue**: Added CancellationToken support; async nested enqueue detection
- **Persistence**: Malformed events now fail-closed; manifest written first with dataHash integrity check
- **SecretStore**: Proactive availability probing instead of passive error detection
- **ContentStore**: Root and initial snapshot entries properly seeded; snapshotEveryNodes=0 NaN bug fixed
- **CtrlZTree**: Hash collision uses monotonic suffix instead of salt; RangeError on Math.max(...largeArray) fixed

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Critical: OOM Memory Leak in Diff Algorithm**: Replaced the memory-heavy O(N×M) 2D matrix dynamic programming in `lcs.ts` with a linear-space prefix/suffix stripping algorithm. Prevents the VS Code Extension Host from crashing (Out-Of-Memory) when editing large files.
- **Critical: Infinite Loop (RangeError)**: Fixed a bug where navigating to a previous state and creating identical text could cause a hash collision, creating a cyclic graph in the tree history. Added cryptographic salt for collisions and a failsafe cycle detector to completely prevent `RangeError: Invalid array length` crashes.
- **Single Character Undo Bug**: Fixed an issue where undoing all the way back in a newly created file left a single character behind. Implemented eager tree initialization upon document open to capture the true empty state.
- **Native Undo Pass-Through**: The extension no longer blocks default undo/redo functionality in untracked editors (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb`, settings panels, and output logs). Native history is preserved for these files.

### Technical Details
- Replaced 2D array LCS with Myers-lite block replacement and prefix/suffix stripping.
- Added `onDidOpenTextDocument` subscription and workspace iteration during `activate()` for eager tracking.
- Added explicit `isTrackableDocument` checks to command registrations to fallback to native `undo`/`redo` commands.
- Implemented `Set`-based cycle detection in `getPathToRoot`.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Critical: Generate Diff Algorithm**: Replaced broken greedy diff algorithm with proper Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) using dynamic programming
  - Fixes incorrect diffs for cases like "abc" → "bac" that would cause silent data corruption
  - Ensures `applyDiff` produces correct results, preventing data loss in tree
- **Critical: Hash Collision Handling**: Fixed `set()` method silently moving head on hash collision
  - Now validates that nodes are actual children before jumping to them
  - Prevents orphaned heads and broken tree structure when navigating to old states
- **Critical: Content Reconstruction Path**: Fixed off-by-one indexing in `reconstructContent` that could skip applying diffs
  - Clarified path traversal logic from root to head
  - Removes confusing index arithmetic that was a bug waiting to happen
- **Critical: Initial Snapshot Undo**: Prevented undoing past initial file snapshot when no changes made
  - First Ctrl+Z on newly opened file now shows "No more undo history" instead of erasing content
  - Initial file content is properly treated as the baseline state
- **Line Diff Performance**: Replaced O(n²) greedy lookahead in `generateLineDiff` with proper LCS DP algorithm
  - Dramatically improves performance for large files
  - Produces better diffs through proper common subsequence detection
- **Diff Summary Performance**: Replaced O(n²) `indexOf()` calls in `generateDiffSummary` with O(n) index-based iteration
  - Improves performance in hot loops for operation processing
- **Document Range Error**: Fixed off-by-one error in `applyTreeStateToDocument` using `document.lineCount`
  - Now correctly calculates range to last line instead of going one line too far
  - Ensures precision document replacement without relying on VS Code's clamping
- **Panel Context Stale State**: Fixed atomic update issue when switching files
  - Panel context now updates `panelDocumentContexts` and `activeVisualizationPanels` together
  - Prevents stale `docUriString` references when reusing panels across files
- **Debug Logging Noise**: Removed production logging of all `dbgCoords` debug events in webview
  - Eliminates excessive coordinate debug messages flooding the output channel
- **Tree Reset Duplicate Node**: Fixed `handleTreeReset` creating unnecessary duplicate nodes
  - Constructor already calls `set()` with initial content, removed the second call
  - Prevents unwanted node duplication during tree reset

### Technical Details
- Implemented Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) DP algorithm for both character-level and line-level diffs
- Improved atomic updates in panel management to prevent race conditions
- Enhanced validation of hash collisions in tree structure

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Configurable History Pruning**: Pruning behavior is now fully configurable via settings
  - `ctrlztree.enablePruning`: Enable/disable automatic pruning (default: true)
  - `ctrlztree.maxHistoryNodesPerDocument`: Maximum nodes per document (default: 1000, min: 100)
  - `ctrlztree.maxTrackedDocuments`: Maximum documents to track (default: 100, min: 1)
- **Memory Management**: History trees now have automatic pruning to prevent unbounded memory growth
  - Automatic pruning when tree exceeds node limit (keeps 95% most recent)
  - Cleanup of oldest document histories when tracking too many files
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced security with strict validation of serialized diffs before deserialization
  - Validates array structure, operation types and properties
  - Proper error messages for malformed diff data

- All code passes strict linting without warnings

## [0.5.4] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- **Startup Activation Restored**: The extension now activates on `onStartupFinished` (plus `onEditSession:file` and command invocation), ensuring change tracking and commands are registered before you type in restored editors without relying on wildcard `*` activation.
- **Eager Change Tracking**: Document listeners spin up during activation so both reopened files and newly created untitled buffers start tracking edits without needing to trigger any command first.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **Automatic Document Resolution**: The `CtrlZTree: Visualize History Tree` command now resolves a document even when triggered before any editor is active, reopening the last valid file or waiting for VS Code to restore one when necessary.
- **Root Visibility & Navigation**: Both the internal empty baseline and the first tracked snapshot are always rendered in the visualization, and undo can now walk all the way back to the empty baseline for true Vim-style history browsing.

### Changed
- **Smarter Panel Context**: Visualization panels keep track of which document they represent, so clicking nodes in a freshly retargeted panel no longer complains about missing hashes or jumps to the wrong file.
- **Initial State Hygiene**: When a document returns to its initial tracked state (either via undo or by selecting the root node), the extension compares the on-disk file with that snapshot and, if they match, automatically clears the dirty indicator so the editor reflects reality.

### Fixed
- **Webview Bootstrap**: Removed CSP-incompatible inline data injection; the panel now waits for a `webviewReady` ping before streaming tree data, eliminating the need to hit the Reload button on startup.
- **Root Node Fallbacks**: Visualization creation gracefully shows the root node even for brand-new empty files, ensuring the tree never appears blank.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- **Root State Undo**: Prevents Ctrl+Z on the very first node from wiping the file by pinning the initial snapshot and refusing to move past it when the document started non-empty.

### Changed
- **Lean Tree Storage**: Tree nodes now keep diffs only (with a single initial snapshot) which dramatically reduces memory churn when working on large files.
- **Rich Node Labels**: Visualization nodes display explicit `+` / `-` segments (including whitespace markers such as `<TAB>` or `spaces x4`) and the selected head node now automatically follows the active document state.
- **Whitespace-Aware Tracking**: Change tracking flushes immediately on newline inserts but batches runs of spaces/tabs for up to 500 ms so blank-character edits land in a single history entry instead of dozens.

### Improved
- **Diff Summaries**: Tooltips and quick-pick previews use the new diff extraction to highlight exactly what text was added or removed, including whitespace-only edits, for much clearer history browsing.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed
- **Missing Webview Assets in VSIX**: Updated packaging configuration (`.vscodeignore`) so the HTML/CSS/JS templates under `src/webview/` are shipped inside the published extension. This resolves ENOENT errors when the visualization webview tries to load its template in production installs.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- **Webview Scrollbar**: Resolved an issue where the visualization panel displayed an unwanted vertical scrollbar by ensuring root/html heights are set and using `box-sizing: border-box` for the `#tree-visualization` container so borders don't cause a 1px overflow.

### Changed
- **Webview Styling**: Small CSS adjustments to the canvas and container (`display: block` on the canvas, `height: 100%` on the visualization) to improve layout stability and diff-button anchoring across themes and zoom levels.

- **Project files updated**: Adjusted project files and documentation (package, README, changelog, and webview assets) for better project management and clarity.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- **Accurate First Node Content**: The first recorded node for any document now stores the complete file contents instead of appearing as an empty placeholder, ensuring tooltips and node labels immediately show meaningful text even before subsequent edits.

### Technical Details
- Added snapshot storage for the very first node in each tree so later operations continue to store only diffs while the initial state remains a full-content entry.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- **Floating Diff Button**: Styled HTML button appears on the current active node
  - Button only shows on the current head node (active state)

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Replaced buggy LCS implementation with working version
- Fixed "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error caused by reconstruction bugs in diff algorithm
- Improved diff reconstruction reliability and performance
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors with proper brace formatting

### Technical Details
- Replaced current `src/lcs.ts` with previously working `lcs_new.ts` implementation
- Fixed conditional statements to use proper braces for TypeScript compliance
- Removed backup files and cleaned up temporary implementations
- The diff algorithm now correctly reconstructs content without infinite loops

## [0.1.6] - 2025-05-31

### Changed
- **Final Cleanup**: Removed temporary test file `test_diff_efficiency.js`
- Extension package is now completely clean with only production files
- Reduced package size further by removing development artifacts

### Technical Details
- Removed `test_diff_efficiency.js` which was used for testing the diff optimization
- Package now contains only essential files for the extension functionality

## [0.1.5] - 2025-05-31

### Changed
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused LCS implementation files
- Cleaned up both source (`src/lcs_new.ts`) and compiled (`out/lcs_old.js`, `out/lcs_new.js`) files
- Extension now uses only the optimized character-based diff implementation

### Technical Details
- Removed duplicate and legacy LCS files to reduce package size
- Kept only `src/lcs.ts` and `out/lcs.js` which contain the active implementation
- Cleaner codebase with no unused files

## [0.1.5] - 2025-01-31

### Changed

- Cleaner codebase with no unused files

## [0.1.4] - 2025-01-31

### Changed
- **Enhanced Tooltips**: Node tooltips now show only the modified part (changes) instead of full content
- Tooltips display added content with `+` prefix and removed content as `-X chars`
- More concise and focused information when hovering over nodes in the tree visualization

### Technical Details
- Added `getDiffPreview()` function to extract meaningful changes from diff operations
- Shows actual added text content and count of removed characters
- Handles parse errors gracefully with informative error messages

## [0.1.3] - 2025-01-31

### Changed
- **MAJOR OPTIMIZATION**: Implemented debouncing for document changes to prevent excessive node creation
- Document changes are now grouped together with a 1-second delay, dramatically reducing tree size
- Only creates new nodes after user pauses typing, not on every keystroke

### Fixed
- Fixed performance issues caused by creating a new tree node for every character typed
- Reduced memory usage and improved extension responsiveness
- Eliminated tree bloat from rapid sequential edits

### Technical Details
- Added debouncing mechanism with 1000ms delay for change processing
- Improved change detection to batch related edits together
- Enhanced cleanup in extension deactivation

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed
- Fixed "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error caused by recursive document change events
- Added robust safeguards to prevent infinite loops in the onDidChangeTextDocument handler
- Improved document processing logic to avoid redundant tree updates

### Changed
- Enhanced change detection to only process document updates when content actually differs from tree state
- Added per-document processing tracking to prevent recursive calls

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- Enhanced node tooltips now show the actual modified text content
- Content preview in tooltips (first 100 characters with line breaks shown as ⏎)
- Better visual feedback when hovering over nodes in the tree visualization

### Changed
- Improved tooltip format: shows both hash and content preview
- Line breaks in content preview are displayed as ⏎ symbol for better readability

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- Initial release
- Tree-based undo/redo functionality
- Visual tree representation with interactive navigation
- Custom keybindings for Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y
- Real-time history tracking
- Branch selection for ambiguous redo operations
